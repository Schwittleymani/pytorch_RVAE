Some argue that the Internet and the new communications technologies arc breaking the corporate stranglehold on journalism and opening an unprecedented era of interactive democratic media .
They now have greater leverage over the media , and the public relations firms working for these and other powerful interests also bulk larger as media sources .
It would be a mistake to conclude from the fact that the public buys and watches the offerings of the increasingly commercialized media that the gradual erosion of the public sphere reflects the preferences and free choices of the public either as citizens or consumers .

There is no need to speculate on the reaction .
They were samidin who do not raise their heads .
Both recognized the need to resort to terror to ensure subordination to the rich men who wish to enjoy their possessions undisturbed .
If the world is suitably frightened , that is a net benefit .
The consequences for terrorism are of only secondary importance ; in fact , U.S. intelligence concludes that bombing of Afghanistan probably increased the threat by scattering the al-Qaeda network and spawning others like it .
The fact that such statements can even be made without evoking ridicule is another sign of the extraordinary successes of the system of indoctrination .
It is law enough , and more than enough , to itself .
Extensive reports of torture by former prisoners have been ignored in the U.S. , but not elsewhere .
Subsequent U.S. commentary on terrorism fulfills these expectations with some precision , a major propaganda coup for state terrorists in Jerusalem and Washington .

But as I have already mentioned , these excuses amount to naught by the standards applied to Muammar Qaddafi and Yasser Arafat , who also condemn terrorist actions and deny responsibility for them .
The attack on Libya may also sooner or later inspire terrorist acts , which will serve to mobilize domestic and foreign opinion in support of U.S. plans at home and abroad .
I do not want to suggest that it is outside the spectrum of American politics .
But no one should be deluded into believing that we are witnessing the operations of fools and bunglers ; their achievements in organizing efficient international terrorism are impressive , from the Middle East to Central America , and beyond .
During the period of hostility , the U.S. continued to provide arms to the Sukarno regime .
Its major known contribution to international terrorism was revealed during the Iran-Contra inquiries : namely , Iran 's perhaps inadvertent involvement in the U.S. proxy war against Nicaragua .
Israel being a client-state , U.S. practice uncritically adopts the Israeli conventions .
When the U.S. and its clients are the agents of terrorist atrocities , they either disappear from the record or are transmuted to acts of retaliation and selfdefense in the service of democracy and human rights .
For that there is ample historical precedent , not to speak of authority in the holiest texts we are taught to revere .
We have no right to harbor any illusions about the premises of the planning for the war in Afghanistan , and of the accompanying commentary .

It is not surprising , therefore , that Europe should be utterly shocked by the terrorist crimes of September 11 .
The immediately announced U.S. reaction was to deal with these problems by intensifying them .

Furthermore , they are almost certainly involved in drug trafficking into Tajikistan .
Terrorism is the use of coercive means aimed at civilian populations in an effort to achieve political , religious , or other aims .
When countries are attacked they try to defend themselves , if they can .
Even as remote as they are from the world outside , Taliban leaders presumably know full well that the Islamic states are not their friends .
Even more dramatically , the idea that Nicaragua should have the right to defend itself was considered outrageous across the mainstream political spectrum in the United States .
Huge numbers of miserable people have been fleeing to the borders in terror after Washington 's threat to bomb the shreds of existence remaining in Afghanistan and to convert the Northern Alliance into a heavily armed military force .

Even before the war , the US had been by far the leading industrial nation in the world - - as it had been since the turn of the century .
His writings are an extremely interesting illustration of the dovish position .
For various reasons , the method adopted has been military spending , in large part .
The CIA was concerned about Communists winning power legally in the crucial Italian elections of 1948 .
Some people , particularly George Kennan , advocated military action before the elections - - he did n't want to take a chance .
There they became military advisers to US-supported police states that were modeled , often quite openly , on the Third Reich .

It 's taking a big step forward with the consolidation of the European Common Market .
When we can no longer control the army of a Latin American country - particularly one in the Caribbean-Central American region - - it 's time to overthrow the government .
Just in Central America , the number of people murdered by US-backed forces since the late 1970s comes to something like 200,000 , as popular movements that sought democracy and social reform were decimated .
All of this passed with scarcely a mention in the country that funded and trained Romero 's assassins .
As usual , these events were considered too insignificant to merit more than a few words in US newspapers .
Later it was involved in the bombing of villages and murder of hundreds of civilians by shooting , drowning and other methods .
This has been a pattern throughout the Battalion 's existence - - some of its worst massacres have occurred when it was fresh from US training .
This devastating hurricane , with its welcome prospects of mass starvation and long-term ecological damage , reinforced our efforts .

Making Guatemala a killing field There was one place in Central America that did get some US media coverage before the Sandinista revolution , and that was Guatemala .
His independence also threatened our interests in the Panama Canal .
In October 1991 , the US once again overrode the strenuous objections of its allies in Europe and Japan , and renewed the embargo and sanctions against Vietnam .
Saddam Hussein is a murderous gangster - - exactly as he was before the Gulf War , when he was our friend and favored trading partner .
For 20 years , the US has been virtually alone in this stance .
This had nothing to do with Iraq and Kuwait .
In the case of Kuwait , the US position was particularly flimsy .
Imagine someone in the US media suggesting that maybe the United States ought to try to rise to the moral level of the Kremlin and admit that the attacks against Vietnam , Laos and Cambodia violated international law .
If we can get them to accept that , they 'll be very easily exploitable , and will move toward their new role as a kind of Brazil or Mexico .
As long as the Soviet Union was in the game , there was a limit to how much force the US could apply , particularly in more remote areas where we did n't have a big conventional force advantage .
You want to lead with your strength , play your strong card .
As a result , negotiations are something the US commonly tries to avoid .

So the CIA undertook to weaken and split the French labor movement - - with the aid of top American labor leaders , who were quite proud of their role .
But the doctrinal meaning of democracy is different - - it refers to a system in which decisions are made by sectors of the business community and related elites .
So we have major corporations selling fairly wealthy and privileged audiences to other businesses .
Most of the material is junk , and you have to read a ton of stuff before you find anything good .

Israel 's military strength is sufficient to prevent the other side from gaining any military objective .
Those who advocate Israeli withdrawal from Judea , Samaria and Gaza have always used the demographic demon as one of their main arguments .
Since September , Israeli lorries have been scooping up truckload after truckload of Lebanon 's fertile topsoil and carting it off to Israel .
Plan D was not a political blueprint for the expulsion of Palestinian Arabs : it was a military plan with military and territorial objectives .
Officially Israel was the adversary , and the Arab states were his allies .
In other words , a fear that a settlement between Israel and Abdallah would only be a stepping stone for the latter - - his next step being attempted expansion into Syria .
We would agree to the conquest of the Arab part of Palestine by Abdullah .
No doubt Abdullah 's preoccupation with bringing Syria into his domain suited and was exploited by the Zionists as a means of diverting him from the equally burning preoccupation with bringing Palestine into his domain .
This fear explains not only Egypt 's intervention - - which was undertaken mainly to foil the plans of Abdallah and his British backers - - but also the overall logic of its military operations .
They discussed the prospects of the resolution to partition Palestine which was then before the United Nations .
This plan was not revealed either to the Cabinet nor to the military command .
The Haganah and Palmach commanders opposed a limited objective war on the eastern front ; they wished to conquer the West Bank territories .

The committees were utilized by the workers in the early months of the revolution to present series of demands , and in some instances to begin to act to realize those demands .
Their domination of the regional and national councils of the factory committees gave them the power to isolate and destroy any factory committee , e.g. , by denying it raw materials .

This commentary illustrates these assessments in relation to two subjects which have attracted much interest in the West recently – terrorism and just war to combat terrorism .
I will try to illustrate these conclusions with two closely related topics of serious current concern that are suggested by these essays : the renewal of concern with terrorism , and the revival of considerations of just war in that context .
The observation is correct , but not very compelling .
Thus , a front-page story in the national press warns that the threat of Al-Qaeda is increasing , as it is turning from targets that are ‘ well protected . . .
Another classic discussion is John Dewey ’ s thoughts on ‘ how far genuine intellectual freedom and social responsibility are possible under the existing economic regime ’ .
Nicaragua was of course not the first target of US terror aimed at ‘ regime change ’ .
We apply this truism to others without hesitation .
Those who cannot accept this truism should have the decency to keep silent about matters of right and wrong , or just war .
In the course of this detailed investigation of English sound patterns and their underlying structure , certain rules of English phonology are developed .
We have investigated certain topics in considerable detail and have neglected certain others in what might appear to be a rather idiosyncratic and unmotivated pattern .
For example , we have studied the stress contours of English in some detail , but we say nothing about the gradations of aspiration that can easily be observed for English stop consonants .
We intend no value judgment here ; we are not asserting that one should be primarily concerned with universal grammar and take an interest in the particular grammar of English only insofar as it provides insight into universal grammar and psychological theory .
In addition to features of English phonology which seem of no general systematic importance , we have omitted from our discussion many topics about which we have not been able to learn enough , though they may very well be of considerable importance .
The speaker produces a signal with a certain intended meaning ; the hearer receives a signal and attempts to determine what was said and what was intended .
On the one hand , the term refers to the explicit theory constructed by the linguist and proposed as a description of the speaker 's competence .
On the other hand , we use the term to refer to this competence itself .
No confusion should result from this standard usage if the distinction is kept in mind .
Suppose that universal phonetics establishes that utterances are sequences of discrete segments , that segments are complexes of a particular set of phonetic features , and that the simultaneous and sequential combinations of these features are subject to a set of specific constraints .
For many reasons , it is necessary to state the rules that determine stress contours as rules of placement of primary stress , rather than as rules of stress weakening .
Neither of these statements is a necessary truth ; 5 each represents an interesting and , for the present , reasonably well-confirmed empirical hypothesis .
We shall have more to say about this matter as we proceed .
Our rules could be slightly modified to accommodate different decisions .
The Nuclear Stress Rule assigns primary stress to the rightmost primary-stressed vowel , weakening all others , and giving the stress contour 2143 .
We assume here that the word American receives primary stress on the second syllable , although we have not yet given the rules that determine this .
Second , it is necessary to formulate a principle for interpretation of phonetic representations that nullifies distinctions that go beyond a certain degree of refinement .
Finally , it is necessary to take note of the qualifications with respect to phonetic representation in general that we discuss in the next section .
We might suppose , on the basis of what has been suggested so far , that a correct description of perceptual processes would be something like this .
The verb erase is bisyllabic , and we see that stress is placed on the second syllable .
The transformational cycle operates within word boundaries in a much more farreaching and extensive way than suggested by examples such as these .
In both cases it is the # boundary preceding the affix which blocks all phonological rules that would otherwise be applicable .
More on the transformational cycle within the word We can now proceed to deepen the account of stress placement within words .
We thus extend the general theory of the organization of a grammar expressed in the principle of the transformational cycle , by observing that certain subsequences of the linearly ordered rules may be disjunctively ordered .
This is now a rule of a familiar form .
The exact status of this rule , which we will call the Stress Adjustment Rule , is a matter to which we will return below .
We have , so far , placed the following conditions on the grammar .
In earlier work these notations have been regarded solely as part of the system for evaluating grammars .
Since the verb undergoes no further applications of the Main Stress Rule , in isolation it retains primary stress in this position .
In the next 1 cycle we consider the adjective orthqdox .
In both cases the stress contour is assigned to the underlying verb by rules that we will give later on .
It is reasonable to suppose that the principle of the transformational cycle and the principles of organization of grammar that we have formulated in terms of certain notational conventions are , if correct , a part of universal grammar rather than of the particular grammar of English .
Further investigation of final unstressed vowels reveals that there is a peculiar gap in the pattern .
There are no examples with e as the final vowel of the lexical representation .
To begin with , let us disregard the question of vowel quality and consider the matter of complexity of the vocalic nucleus .
The points to be noted are the following .
We will not consider at this point the question of how , in detail , this vowel is phonetically realized in various contexts and dialects .
We have also assumed that there may be a somewhat more complex principle of ordering within the linear sequence of rules .
In Chapter Eight , we return to a brief consideration of readjustment rules .
In the case of braces , however , the ordering is assumed to be conjunctive .
This slight deviation from ordinary orthography serves the present purpose of identifying certain vocalic nuclei as tense ; but as we have already seen in Chapter Two , it has much other justification as well .
It is thus one of the factors contributing to the frequently observed predominance of iambic rhythms in English .
The other examples are derived in the same way .
The reason for including polyhedral and polyhedrous in column II rather than column III will be given directly .
The final stress then becomes tertiary by the Stress Adjustment Rule .
The stress is then further reduced to tertiary by the Stress Adjustment Rule .
We shall see directly that this is not possible , however .
Other rules , to which we will turn later , give the desired phonetic representation .
According to our rules , as so far established , the primary stress of this word should be on syl - rather than mon - .
The verbs , in each case , have tertiary stress and a nonreduced vowel in the final syllable ; the nouns have zero stress and a reduced vowel .
For any particular dialect , theleature specifications and the appropriate phonetic rules can be established .
In short , we are formulating the rules so as to generate what we take to be the phonetic representation underlying our normal pronunciation , in agreement with Kenyon and Knott in crucial cases .
Furthermore , the vowels which do not reduce even though nontense and minus-stressed are phonetically tense .
We are therefore forced to leave this as an open problem .
If this conception of the role of the rules for assignment of secondary stress is correct , then the suggested generalization of the convention for stress assignment is a spurious one and inappropriate for the rules in question .
In this section we will sharpen and extend the rules of primary stress placement that involve derivational affixes .
We shall see in the next chapter that there is a diacritic feature introduced by readjustment rules into segments of formatives that are subject to derivational processes .
The initial vowel of advise and advisory reduces , despite the double consonant that follows it , because of the intervening = boundary .
In the second cycle the affix - y places primary stress on the preceding strong cluster in the usual way .
We have made no attempt to investigate the exact domain of the categorial feature in detail .
Under any reasonable evaluation measure-in particular , that which we shall discuss-the notations used in abbreviating rules do not count in determining the value of the system of rules .
The exact position of this rule in the sequence of rules will concern us later .
Thus the word Mississippi , for example , terminating with the phonological segments f ...
Some modifications of these representations are required by considerations developed in the next chapter .
We have throughout been limiting ourselves arbitrarily to problems of phonological interpretation , and are making no attempt in the present study to investigate the processes by which the syntactic component of the grammar forms the surface structures that are phonetically interpreted by the rules we have been discussing here .
In each such case an ad hoc lexical analysis must be given for the underlying forms , specifying that they undergo the necessary reanalysis before the application of the phonological rules .
Insofar as this attempt is successful , it provides empirical justification for these principles .
These formatives are provided originally by the lexicon , which forms one part of the syntactic component of the grammar .
As we noted in Chapter One , each formative falls into many categories ; in fact , each formative can be regarded as being constituted simply by a certain set of categories .
Suppose that a certain formative meets the following condition : the phonological matrix given in its lexical entry is a submatrix of the phonetic matrix corresponding to it , in each context in which it occurs .
Occasionally the factors that determine what the underlying lexical entry must be are quite complex .
However , the actual forms are determined by quite simple rules , and the choice of the underlying vowel is determined by a variety of systematic considerations .
Recall that the phonetic features constitute a fixed and restricted set , independent of any particular language .
No harm is done , however , by allowing Convention 2 to apply quite generally .
There are other aspects of the problem of exceptions not taken care of in the system presented above .
ALTERNATIONS OF NONBACK VOWELS Consider first forms such as divine-divinity , serene-serenity , profane-profanity .
This is a minimum of reversibility that is inescapable .
In our presentation of the Vowel Shift Rule , we made a number of tacit assumptions which must now be stated explicitly and properly justified .
We have already observed that for a tense stressed vowel to be exempt from Vowel Shift , it must not be the same in rounding and backness .
Similarly , verbs such as rise-rose and take-took require double application of the Vowel Shift Rule in their past tense forms .
These forms are inadmissible in the English dialects that we are studying and must be excluded by appropriate rules .
Summarizing the phonetic variety of underlying high back vowels , we have the following situation .
This rule falls together with the Rounding Adjustment Rule and therefore comes after Vowel Shift in the ordering of the rules .
Considerations involving general conditions on plausible phonological rules which we discuss in Chapter Nine suggest that there is a principled reason for the ordering of processes that we propose .
We will present here what seems to be the core of the system of rules involving consonants , listing the rules in the order in which they appear , with a few comments about each .
As the present discussion is rather informal , however , we shall not incorporate this consequence into the rule .
Consider the word righteous , which is clearly derived from right .
Furthermore , we can use it to explain alternations such as resign-resignation , paradigm-paradigmatic .
The rules that we have given fall into two general classes : the rules of the readjustment component and the phonological rules .
There is , however , a still more serious reason for suspecting that the two processes under discussion do not fall together .
We turn now to a summary of the rules .
So far as I know it has always been an entirely speculative picture whose best feature is a surface plausibility which it once possessed but does not possess any more .
In the fifteenth century English underwent what is traditionally known as the Great Vowel Shift .
Since this is a totally isolated instance , we shall not attempt to offer an explanation for it , but shall regard it as a special idiosyncracy without systematic significance .
The other dimension reflects the location in the mouth of the major constriction .
The preceding accounts for the major features of Wallis ' speech except fore foemininum .
Similar exclusions do not apply if the order is reversed , as it is in the second dialect described by Wallis .
The differences observed between the dialects would therefore seem to be the result of the addition of rules .
Our conception thus differs from an alternative view that the phonetic transcription is primarily a device for recording facts observed in actual utterances .
In other words the dependence of perception on properties physically present in the signal is less than total .
A grammar must include a list of these items , for part of a speaker 's knowledge of his language consists of knowing the lexical items of the language .
The representations of the individual items in the lexicon must incorporate the knowledge which makes it possible for the speaker to utilize each lexical item in grammatically correct sentences .
This includes certain syntactic information which the speaker must have .
The latter solution may appear especially attractive in cases where a slight redefinition of some phonetic feature would readily accommodate the proposed solution .
We are well aware of the many gaps in our knowledge that make the success of this undertaking somewhat problematical , but we feel that general phonetics has been neglected for so long that agreement on even the most elementary propositions of phonetic theory cannot be taken for granted at present .
Nonretroflex vowels are , of course , noncoronal .
The clicks will therefore be discussed when we deal with suction mechanisms in Section 5.3.1 .
It is , however , quite sufficient to note that the point of contact between the tongue and the roof of the mouth is somewhat more advanced in one language than the other .
In Temne the nondistributed consonant is articulated at the teeth , whereas the distributed consonant is articulated somewhat farther back .
The fact that there are other feature distinctions between these two classes of sounds makes this distinction in the length of stricture somewhat peripheral , though no less real .
We shall assume that covered sounds are produced with a pharynx in which the walls are narrowed and tensed and the larynx raised ; uncovered sounds are produced without a special narrowing and tensing in the pharynx .
It would appear , therefore , that phonetically we have to recognize a feature that governs the timing of different movements within the limits of a single segment .
This evidently is ~ click with nasalization , whereas the other five types of click are nonnasal .
The click system of Xhosa , perhaps the best known of the click languages , is somewhat different from that of Hottentot .
In order for the vocal cords to vibrate , it is necessary that air flow through them .
All these must be produced with vocal cords in voicing position and without tenseness .
The aspirated stops will , moreover , have high subglottal pressure and no glottal constriction .
Consider next a possible convention that all rules apply simultaneously .
Like Sapir we represent voiceless vowels , nasals , and glides by capital letters .
Metathesis , contraction , and elision The phonological rules that have been discussed in the preceding sections of this chapter have been characterized by having a single segment on the left-hand side of the arrow .
Before formulating the elision rules , we will extend our formalism to provide for the deletion of units and the introduction of units into strings .
If this turned out to be unsatisfactory , we could easily invent any number of different conventions .
The Contraction Rule makes it unnecessary to postulate M and fre/ in the underlying representations , for these will now be derived from fauf and faif .
It is , therefore , part of the representation of every formative in the lexicon .
The converse is not true , however : a rule that applies to the string X + Z does not also apply to the string XZ .
The relation between disjunctive ordering and the notational device of parenthesization is discussed in Section 1.2 of Chapter Three .
The matter is not relevant here , and we will continue to suppose that the stronger assumption is justified .
This boundary also exempts the form wiped from the laxing rule which normally operates before nondental consonant clusters .
However , it is also necessary for the # boundary to be eliminated before application of the stress placement rules in the second cycle , since the affixes are not neutral with respect to stress placement .
Therefore , the elimination of internal # in these examples can be taken care of by a lexical rule which will be automatic with these and various other affixes and which will affect the boundary but not the constituent structure .
This rule is blocked in forms such as con=de=scend , contra=dict , inter=ject because of the appearance of a = boundary .
All nonphonological features of a given lexical item are distributed to every unit .
An example illustrating the way in which readjustment rules operate in such cases is discussed at the end of this section .
There are , however , a number of differences between the vowel harmony in these West African languages and that in Nez Perce .
As we have seen , information of this type can be provided by the syntactic and diacritic features that form part of each lexical entry .
However , Lightner showed that both conventions lead to specious simplifications in that they make it possible to distinguish items that are not represented as distinct in the lexicon .
We might handle exceptions in the following way .
Under formal conditions of a highly abstract sort , the relation of disjunctive ordering is assigned to certain pairs of rules .
A great many of the problems discussed in this chapter were first investigated by the phonologists of the Prague Circle , notably Trubetzkoy and Jakobson .
After a consonant , vowels are fully unmarked and glides fully marked .
The condition asserts that one should minimize the number of features available for distinguishing lexical items .
The fourth vowel must be selected from among those of complexity 2 if the total complexity is to be minimized .
These conventions are quite similar to the vowel conventions except that noncontinuant glides are permitted .
This measure of distance can be refined in various ways .
We would therefore expect that in such a case cluster-unvoicing would , in general , be a property of formatives rather than of individual clusters .
List frequency of exceptions , in the lexicon , would therefore be a relevant factor in determining degree of admissibility .
Supporting evidence for this approach comes from another property of point-ofarticulation assimilation of nasals before stops .
We now have machinery for making some of these distinctions .
However , since the dating of the palatalization processes is irrelevant for the purposes of the following discussion , we shall not concern ourselves with this question any further ; we shall simply assume that we are examining the stage in the development of the Slavic languages at which the palatalizations were productive .
We are clearly quite far from achieving this goal , but certain facts suggest that this may be a fruitful direction in which to pursue further inquiry .
Confirmation that arises from considerations internal to a grammar is much more significant than any observations on what is commonly to be found .
In the light of the marking conventions , the historical process that we have postulated makes use of rules that are quite natural , whereas the alternative rules that we rejected in Chapter Six would be highly complex and implausible .
We now ask whether the rule needs any modification in view of the considerations of this section .
I think those are fine things to do .
In fact so advanced , that power systems - - state and private - began to recognize that things were getting to a point where they ca n't control the population by force as easily as before , so they are going to have to turn to other means of control .
One of the things that happened was controlling students - - in fact , controlling students for the rest of their lives , by simply trapping them in debt .
And that 's healthy for the economy from a certain point of view , a point of view that says workers ought to be oppressed and controlled , and that wealth ought to be concentrated in a very few pockets .
Concern for the environment - - which is nowhere near where it ought to be , but far beyond the 1960s .
Educated opinion succeeded in suspending disbelief over the timing of the pronouncement as well , greeting it with due solemnity .
The locales number in the hundreds , perhaps thousands .
The 1970s began a major turning point in American history .
That was true even in very dark times .
The activism of the 196os , after a pretty dismal decade , really civilized the country in lots of ways that are permanent .
There are a lot of reasons for it .
Alongside of this began the very sharp rise in the costs of elections , which drives the political parties even deeper than before into the pockets of the corporate sector .
We all know or should know that the United States is extremely backward globally in high-speed transportation , and it 's very serious .
There are very dangerous developments in the international arena , including two of them , which are a kind of a shadow that hangs over everything we 've discussed .
It 's kind of a miracle that we 've escaped it .
Though it is n't being much discussed , that threat is in fact being escalated by policies of this administration and its allies .
The other , of course , is environmental catastrophe .
The candidate comes to town with his public relations agents and the rest of them .
In fact , it 's not even a major problem .
And it 's been happening in other places , New York , and elsewhere .
It goes on to include the interests of groups and their particular concerns , some of which are quite far reaching .
Occupy Wall Street is more like a Hooverville .
There has n't been that kind of large-scale organizing .
There is a new small book by the Economic Policy Institute called Failure by Design : The Story behind America 's Broken Economy .
There are people who think you can sketch it out in great detail , but my own feeling here-I essentially agree with Marx-is that these things have to be worked out by people who are living and functioning in freedom and work out for themselves what kinds of societies and communities are appropriate for them .
Those are goals that we 'll attempt to realize .
In fact , the U.S. is off the spectrum on this .
Some occupations have , in effect , been removed .
And they bitterly condemned the way the industrial system was taking away their freedom and liberty and imposing on them rigid hierarchical structures that they did n't want .
One of the real achievements of the Occupy movement , I think , has been to develop a real manifestation of rejection of this in a very striking way .
The suburbs of Brazil are where most of the poor people live .
I do n't think there 's any particular formula to go about doing it any more than there has been in any other popular movement .
There are a lot of ways to go about overcoming that ; some reach as far as organizing for constitutional conventions in order to take away corporate personhood .
About a century ago , he was asked what was important in politics .
He talked about things not unlike what David Hume was saying-how cultural hegemony was established by systems of power .
I think it 's the first war in history where there was massive protest before the war was officially launched .
And I think one reason they were n't tried was because it was understood that the public was not going to tolerate them this time .
The country is a much more civilized place now than it was in the 196os in many respects .
But if the Occupy movement had been around back then and had been active and energetic enough and had reached out sufficiently , that 's the kind of thing it could have participated in and supported ; and maybe it could have helped the workers gain the edge they needed to win .
There are things practically everybody can do , and if you are from a privileged sector of the population , then there are even more opportunities .
They ended up the way I described , mostly written out of history by Northern liberals .
A year later , there were big demonstrations .
A combination that is essential if there is to be hope of decent survival .

Well , that sends a message to the world .

It 's much harder to pull off today , of course , at least within the anarchist movement itself Anarchism is more wide­ spread and visible-validation and community within it much easier to find .
His work was mired in the nineteenth century language of anarchism .
It also explains the myriad of examples Chomsky gives of how to move towards anarchy , many of which implicitly suggest the rich­ ness of character and ability to provide mutual aid prevalent in many people .

It is relevant to observe , at this point , that a number of the Spanish Communist leaders were reluctantly forced to similar conclusions .

This book , by a UP correspondent in Spain during the Civil War , contains a great deal of important doc­ umentary evidence bearing on the questions considered here .
This brilliant book received little notice at the time of its first publication , no doubt because the picture Orwell drew was in sharp conflict with established liberal dogma .
There were no pri­ vate motor cars , they had all been commandeered , and all the trams and taxis and much of the other transport were painted red and black .
Orwell arrived in Barcelona in late December 1936 .
The har­ vest was distributed III the same way .
It is striking that his argument , up to this point , follows a familiar Cartesian model .
However , I think that Rousseau 's remarks might be interpreted as a development of the Cartesian tradition in an unexplored direction , rather than as a denial and rejection of it .
The isolated man is no more able to develop than the one who is fettered .
Social action must be animated by a vision of a future society , and by explicit judgments of value concerning the character of this future society .
Rousseau he regards as a precursor of authoritarian doctrine , but he considers only the Social Contract , not the far morc lib­ ertarian Discourse on Inequality .
Thei rs must he the task of freeing lahar from all the fetters which economic exploitation has fastened on it , of freeing society from al1 the institutions and procedure of political power , and of opening the way to an alliance of free groups of men and women based on co-operative lahar and a planned administration of things in the interest of the commu­ nicy .
NOTES This essay is a revised version of the introduction to Daniel Guerin 's Anarchism : From Theory to Practice .
These are questions which will have to be worked out .
As for political panies , my feeling is that an anarchist sociery would not forcefully prevem political parties from arising .
That 's perfectly possible , and it should be or could be a barrier against the creation of the kind of remote coercive bureaucracy that anarchists of course fear .
Well , there 's a cenain amounr of work that JUSt has to be done if we 're to maintain that standard of living .
Wel l , in that case , the answer 's quite sim­ ple : that work has ro be equally shared among people capable of doing it .
I would argue myself for the second rather than the third , but either of the two is quite remote from any present social organiz.ation or any tendency in con­ temporary socjal organization .
Now I do n't see why that should in any way harm , in fact I should think it would enhance , the value of what 's produced .
And again I feel the nature of the compromise is much exaggerated because of the distorting prism of the really coercive and personally destructive system in which we live .
And then the building of still further libertarian institutions to which these liberated human beings can contribute : this is the evolution of socialism as I understand it .
Even despotic rule is commonly founded on a measure of consent , and the abdication of rights is the hallmark of more free societies-a fact that calls for analysis .
In congressional elec­ tions , virtually all incumbents are returned to office , a reflection of the vacuity of the political system and the choices it offers .
Businessmen might have to adjust to having workers on their boards of directors , he feared , among other disasters if the Bolshevik virus were not exterminated .
And it was also neces­ sary to defend the civilized order against the popular enemy at home .
Early Sandinista successes in instituting social reforms and production for domestic needs set the alarm bells ringing in Washington and New York .
The courage and dedication of people struggling for freedom , their willingness to confront extreme state terror and violence , is often amazing .
Bur the perspective is a valid one , I think , and can lead us quire a long way .
Physics ca n't really explain how water flows from lIle : lap ill yuur sillk .
The achievements of Spanish workers and peasants , before the revolution was crushed , were impressive in many ways .
Which result enSLLes depends on what we make of the opportunities .
I have to clarifY what I mean by that .
I 'll keep to that case ; as far as I know , it is much the same elsewhere .
The grams of rights and the legal theory that lay behind them are rooted in much the same intellectual soil as nourished the other twO major forms of 20th cemury totalitarianism , fascism and Bolshevism .
The insight was considered so profound that it was highlighted in a special box by the editors .
So these are all perfectly consistent , it 's not a third option ; it 's part of the second oprion I was describing .
For years , the only journals I could write in were ultra-right libertarian journals because we agree on a lot of things .
If YOLI think these things through a little bit , I mean , one slogan does n't give you the answer .
One of the things that intellectuals do is make them inaccessible , for various rea­ sons , including the reasons of domination and personal privilege .
One should be very skeptical about that , that 's anmher technique by which intellectuals dominate people in my opinIon .
People make judgements on the basis of the information available .
It 's nor that we do n't know what people believe .
At some further stage of self-enlighten­ ment and communal understanding we will recognize that those are the things we have to deal with and we ca n't plan for them if we do n't know about them .
And , of course , they wam Wall Street to make a killing .
It 's a social and community responsibility to care whether a disabled widow across town has enough food to eat , or whether a kid across the street can go to school .
If that disabled widow did n't prepare for her own future , it 's her problem not your problem .
I mean , I would say that I 've never seen 95 percent of my close friends .
There is a huge difference between giving orders and taking them .
First of all , outsourcing is a very misleading term .
If GM outsources , that means they are transferring jobs to some firm under their control which is able to escape labor laws , environmental constraints and so on and to give them cheap inputs for the next stage of manufacturing .
It has to do with internal workings of command economies .
And , I do n't think you 'd get away with it now .
They were dedicated Marxists who believed that a backward , primitive country like Russia ca n't go to socialism because the Master 's principles tell us that .
We know there is , we know what that cost is-nm just in energy and effort , but in punishment .
My grandmother could n't join the women 's movement , since she did n't feci any oppression , in some sense .
My feeling is thar any imeraction among human beings that is more than personal-meaning that takes institutional forms of one kind or another-in community , or workplace , family .
But the United States continues to back Israel ’ s refusal of a political settlement in these terms .
In the case of Saudi Arabia , it is unclear just what these conditions are .
Such limitations are inherent in the concept of a Jewish state that also contains non-Jewish citizens .
Much has been made in the West of the refusal of the Arab states to settle the regional conflict through direct negotiation with Israel , but it has less often been noted that Israel has not only refused categorically to negotiate with the Palestiniansand still does-but has even officially denied their existence as a national entity .
The intransigence of the Israeli government and the public in general on this issue was reinforced by the solid support it received in the United States , where a kind of hysteria almost made discussion i m p ~ s s i b l eThe .
Settlements o n the Golan Heights were also intended t o determine facts , which will be difficult to alter when the time comes .
One might add that a system of balkanization under the American aegis , while perhaps fairly stable , nevertheless contains explosive forces that might erupt into a major war .
Under any arrangement that can be imagined for the near future , Israel will remain a Jewish state-that is , a state based on the principle of discrimination .
Changing events have led to a reassessment in a number of respects , and there can be little doubt that this will continue to be the case .
As noted in the introductory remarks , I did not keep to the assigned title , retained here .
And finally , I want to stress several factors that limit the significance of anything I have to say .
To begin with some personal background : I grew up with a deep interest in the revival of Hebrew culture associated with the settlement of Palestine .
Let me turn next to certain reservations that I have about discussing the topic at all .
I suspect that the major contribution that can be made in the United States , or outside the Palestine area , is more indirect .
Peace with justice is excluded from the start .
Israeli retaliation is seen by al-Fatah leadership as a major weapon in their arsenal .
Thus we should become a small and low people in spiritual servitude , looking with envy towards the mighty fist.36 Parallel comments apply with respect to the Arab states and the Arab liberation movements .
But there are some historical precedents that are hopeful .
By so doing , it may help to give substance and reality to a more sympathetic and constructive interpretation .
This way , it seems to me , lies tragedy and bitterness .
It may even be possible to work toward them .
Israel is , at the moment , the more powerful military force by a large margin .
Even in the short run , it is a losing strategy .
For this reason alone-it is not the only onethe left has been deeply concerned with the evolution of the Palestinian movements .
Specifically : As to the Arabs-the element that now resides in the land but is foreign in its essence to the land and its promise-their sentence must be that of all previous foreign elements .
What this postulate overlooks is the dynamics of conflict .
But at present , it is in a very strong position ; with respect to the Palestinian Arabs , it is in a position of overwhelming military dominance .
But what is desperately lacking on the Arab side is the combination of administrative and technical professionalism needed to guarantee , for example , high serviceability and sortie rates .
If these reports are correct , the Israeli military advantage in offensive weaponry is even greater than previously supposed .
He reports that in northern Jerusalem a new Jewish town of 40,000-50,000 residents is being proposed and cites reports that large Israeli housing projects are under way throughout the area .
Israel has the capability to develop a program of this sort , and there is every reason to expect that it will continue to receive public support .
A non-Jewish citizen suffers various forms of discrimination .
I t also reveals that the legal structure of the state , as well as its customary social practices , will be inherently discriminatory .
Any agreement must be such that allows Jewish settlement everywhere .
In many cases , problems of Israel and the Middle East are incidental to domestic political issues and are cynically exploited as a device for undermining the peace movement and the New Left .
There is extensive and quite natural sympathy for Israel within the United States .
We can all agree , I presume , that it is no service to Israel or to the search for a just peace when this sympathy is exploited for personal political vendettas .
Until October , American policy seemed a qualified success .
The matter would be still more serious if the oil producers were to expand state control or shift allegiance to Japanese or Western European state and corporate power .
There is every reason to expect Russian cooperation .
Realists on both sides will dismiss such possibilities , insisting that nations must organize themselves in a system of competing states for the purposes of mutual destruction and oppression .
Not even Alsop ’ s imagination can construct a comparison between this article and Stone ’ s book on the Korean War .
Since the intelligentsia are the custodians of history , we can anticipate that the 1960s will be reconstructed to meet the need .
Still , the predictability of the response does not in itself justify dismissing it as simply another outbreak of the deplorable fanaticism of the past few years .
Before the establishment of Israel , the Zionist movement gave no encouragement to resettlement of Jewish refugees outside of Palestine .
On the matter of the flight of refugees , Hertzberg has the following to say : As a matter of fact , the Arab refugee problem began in the war of 1948 in large part because the Arabs . . .
Now a look at Howe ’ s premises .
In the occupied territories , no serious form of political organization has been tolerated .
But the examples I have discussed here and in the references cited do not fall within this category .
Argument and evidence are , as always , quite beside the point .
He makes it clear , with the obligatory insults and with arguments that deserve no comment , that he regards socialist binationalism of the sort I have discussed as an absurdity .
The United States , with its vast military and economic aid51 to several countries in the region and with the massive investments of American corporations in petroleum and increasingly other projects , is deeply involved in affairs of the Middle East .
Under Clinton , Washington has extended these aspects of the Monroe Doctrine to the Middle East as well .
In the Middle East , family dictatorships are preferred .
These simple realities explain a good deal about U.S. policies in the region , including the peace process .
As senior partner , the United States took charge of most of the rest of the countries in the Middle East .
The targets of subversion and attack often did turn to the USSR for support , sometimes for independent reasons as well , just as Islamic fundamentalist extremists in Afghanistan turned to the United States for support against Russian aggression .
Its location at the center of the Arab Muslim Middle East predestines Israel to be a devoted guardian of stability in all the countries surrounding it .
My third and last comment is that the United States plays a significant and often decisive role in these cases .
That is the important fact , and it ’ s very enlightening to see the reaction .
In fact it is understood in the world that others are naturally impelled to seek weapons of mass destruction of their own as a deterrent .
The leading recipients , Israel and Egypt , are in a separate category .
This is the part that concerns me most and is the part that should concern us most .
They do not have the capacity , so they have to get them from the United States .
By the time of the Second World War , the United States had become the overwhelmingly dominant world power and was plainly going to take over Middle East energy resources .
Pakistan and Turkey were part of the system too at that time .
However horrendous the regime may be , the fact of the matter was that it was using its resources domestically , leading to substantial social and economic development .
And furthermore it offers means to break strikes , a device commonly used by U.S. manufacturers , who develop excess capacity abroad that can be used to break strikes here .
It is important to recall that the policies have not only been proposed but also implemented with the support of the United States .
Many sophisticated answers have been proposed , but some simple ones come to mind .
The Rogers Plan implied acceptance of the existence of the State of Israel as a sovereign state within recognized borders .
I could only take this to reflect the fear that expression of these views might cause doubt and controversy .
He is rather disparaging and regards the organization more as a nuisance than a threat .
Rather , the point is that this remarkable court decision alone suffices to refute Howe ’ s contention .

The general conception of the police that such a quantity of rules and regulations could convey to an administrator like De Lamare is what I 'd like to emphasize .
They were used to teach the science of administration somewhat later on .
Here it was that the Prussian , Austrian , and Russian civil servants-those who were to carry out Joseph II 's and Catherine the Great 's reforms-were trained .
I have been looking for exceptions for many years .
In this case , objective analysis happens to be unusually easy .
And even that tepid support was based on the presupposition that the targets were known to have been responsible for the 11 September attacks .
The tacit assumption is that norms are established by the powerful and that they alone have the right of anticipatory self-defence .

Japan was helped to industrialize , but the United States maintained control over its energy supplies and oil-refining facilities .
Our values have changed very little over the years .
U.S. assessments of Israel and the Palestinians have hardly changed since that time .
Saudi Arabia was virtually at war with both Israel and Iran , which had conquered Arab islands in the Gulf .
And not surprisingly , we find that the United States has blocked a political settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict for twenty years .
The tactical divide of twenty years ago still exists in elite circles , and might lead to internal pressures for the United States to join the world community on this matter .
Neither Peres nor Reagan has been willing to consider the explicit proposals by the PLO - which has as much legitimacy as did the Zionist organisation in 1947 - for negotiations leading to mutual recognition in a two-state settlement in accord with the broad international consensus that has been blocked at every turn by the US and Israel for many years .
The people who were in the bombed buildings were torn to shreds beyond recognition .
We were astounded by your attitude to the Lebanese civilians ’ , a feeling shared by Israeli soldiers and senior officers who were appalled at the savagery of the attack and the treatment of civilians and prisoners ‘ - though support in Israel for the aggression and for the Begin-Sharon team increased in parallel to the atrocities , reaching its very high peak after the terror bombing of Beirut in August .
The US did not even warn the victims - close American allies - that the killers were on the way .
In its lengthy year-end review of terrorism , the New York Times briefly notes the Tunis bombing as an example of retaliation , not terrorism .
These were among numerous other atrocities that a western diplomat who often travels in the area described as new depths of ’ calculated brutality and arbitrary murder ’ .
But let us look into it , in the interest of exploring the concepts of terrorism and retaliation .
A UPI story on Arafat ’ s proposals was featured in the San Francisco Examiner , and the facts were reported without prominence in the local quality press .
One might mention the first airplane hijacking in the Middle East , which is also not familiar fare .

But surely this is a curious way to read .
T o my knowledge , the CALU has always been presented as in effect an observation , and far from a novel one .
There are other examples , but perhaps this sample suffices .
To answer the question we must first identify the perpetrators of the crimes .
Even without pursuing such possibilities , the likelihood is that an attack on Afghans will have pretty much the effect that most analysts expect : it will enlist great numbers of others to support of Bin Laden , as he hopes .
I would like to consider three major ones .
The most general thesis is that history is converging towards an ideal of liberal democracy and classical markets .
A critique of administration policy in the New York Review by George Ball opens : With the end of the cold war and the onset of the Gulf crisis , the United States can now test the validity of the Wilsonian concept of collective security - a test which an automatic Soviet veto in the Security Council has precluded for the past forty years .
It also eliminated the space for a limited degree of independence in the Third World .
The utter hypocrisy of the posturing about the Gulf War is underscored further by events of February 1991 .
They were appealing ' to the proletariat of all countries , to the ignorant and mentally deficient , who by their numbers are urged to become masters ...
The text of this intricate treaty was provided to it one day before .
Also Challengeto the South , one of many expressions of Third World dismay over the events and prospects .
That reminds me of the story of the emperor Alexander and his encounter with a pirate .
Here , we don ’ t. That ’ s real obedience .
No one suggested that Israel should be invaded and half destroyed .
So , in addition to the major prison in Gaza , several prisons are being established on the West Bank .
It doesn ’ t think Israel ought to exist .
The current invasion of Lebanon is the ﬁfth in the last thirty years .
She was also involved in organizing the polls .
It was kind of like ﬁghting what the United States called the Viet Cong , the ofﬁcial propaganda term for the National Liberation Front forces in South Vietnam , who were really just the population .
Not for the Afghans—the U.S. mobilization probably prolonged the Russian occupation—but against the Cold War enemy .
They knew perfectly well that Saudi Arabia was funding the extremist madrassas , the religious schools that undermined the Pakistani educational system , which had been pretty good beforehand .
We continue the threats , which are a violation of the UN Charter .
In other words , the United States is still refusing to negotiate .
Even with controlled experiments , there are plenty of problems .
There is nothing controversial about Chávez saying that the United States is one of the greatest threats to peace in the world .
They don ’ t. So take a look at yourself .
They care about their culture and civilization and their life .
There was a plague of repression throughout the continent .
The doctors are a particularly grisly case , but there are other examples .
It ’ s based mostly on primary product export .
If you take a look at the Mexican border , it was once pretty open , porous in both directions .
Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize.14 He started the Grameen Bank in that country .
It ’ s based on microcredit loans to mostly poor women in rural areas .
Empowering women is extremely important in third world countries—actually , in most communities .
Liberation theology , in Brazil particularly , brought the actual Gospels to peasants .
By today ’ s standards , he would be regarded as a charlatan .
It means making changes in the cultural background and other kinds of organization—support and solidarity and so on .
There has been talk of Venezuela and Iran pricing their oil sales in euros .
What the scale would be is hard to judge .
From a military point of view , almost surely not .
So it appears from what we know that the Israeli bombing initiated Iraq ’ s nuclear weapons development program .
Hatred and fear of the United States and Israel would escalate to an immeasurable degree .
In a really well indoctrinated society , you cannot consider unthinkable thoughts .
The only problem with that is it ’ s not an exception .
Shortly after this came the Ocean Hill and Brownsville conﬂict in New York , the struggle between the teachers ’ unions and the black communities .
And now the people down at the bottom were trying to do what they had done thirty years ago—run their own schools , ﬁght for their own rights .
Warren Buffet has just bought up a big industry in Israel .
And nowhere near enough is being done about it or even talked about except among specialist circles , kind of like global warming twenty years ago .
Now at least global warming is sort of in the open .
Another issue is the global availability of fresh water .
That ’ s a signiﬁcant part of the background for World War II in the Paciﬁc—a major part , in fact .
So of course they ’ re going to ﬁnd ways around missile defense .
The same is true with the uproar about the Russian president , Vladimir Putin , re-creating the Cold War by objecting to an anti-missile system in eastern Europe.21 There is the speech he gave in Munich .
Suppose Iran had nuclear weapons and missiles that could reach Europe .
A good scientist is one who knows what to look for , so you disregard tons of stuff and you see a little thing somewhere else .
Anything can be a problem , but by and large I think it ’ s a good thing .
And it ’ s supported by the facts .
The title of this book is What We Say Goes .
This arrangement is part of the Camp David agreements from back in 1979 , unofﬁcially .
But they do it , because reducing the use of drugs is not the goal .
That was supposed to be the Grand Area .
One assumption people make about you is that there is some urgent connection between your work in linguistics and your political activism .
Kennan quoted in Walter LaFeber , Inevitable Revolutions : The United States in Central America , rev .
Saddam may have been despised almost everywhere , but it was only in the United States that a majority of the population were terrified of what he might do to them , tomorrow .
That has been achieved before , in amazing ways during the Reagan years , and there is a long and illuminating earlier history .
In recent history , both governments strongly supported Saddam Hussein ’ s terrorist regime through the period of his worst crimes , and long after the end of the war with Iran .
He is bitterly hated in the United States because of his independence and enormous popular support .
The United States is a global power , and its policies should not be viewed in isolation , any more than those of the British Empire .
A second step would be to join with other efforts to reintegrate Iran into the global economy .
We might also recall that France and Britain played the crucial role in development of Israel ’ s nuclear arsenal .
Vonnegut arrived at the 1999 celebration of MR ’ s fiftieth anniversary without a ticket .
I decided to ask the renowned Israeli historian Ilan Pappe if he would participate in a joint interview/dialogue with Professor Chomsky .
Selected articles by Ilan Pappe give the necessary historical background that is key to understanding Palestine today .
None of this merits more than a yawn in the West .
That tells us quite a lot about the reigning intellectual culture .
In their final press conference , the negotiators expressed some hope that if they had been permitted to continue their joint work , a settlement could have been reached .
Edward had much more faith in the importance and the integrity of respected intellectuals than I do .
This gap stems from the modern historiographical impulse to—in the words of Hayden White - organize reality with the same clarity as a novelist seeking to construct a lucid world in which a plot has a clear beginning and an end .
Historiography is a constructive effort that is meant to expose the past as it really was—if we believe in such a possibility—or , for the sake of making a contemporary point , if we doubt that possibility .
But anyone who dares to dive into the ocean of words to be found in the political and diplomatic documents in the various national archives understands how precarious is the story extracted from these heaps of documents , left behind by the chattering classes , that shaped our lives over the last two centuries .
Theirs was a doomsday vision that included the return of the Jews to their biblical homeland , followed by their conversion to Christianity on the way to a full realization of the apocalyptic prophecies .
Newton is a circular suburb and at its center , in a typical New England wood , lies the theological seminary of Andover .
Middle East , built on friendly Arab regimes .
Conference agreed to delay the establishment of mandate regimes in Syria , Lebanon , and Palestine .
It was more of a front that included not only oil businessmen but also the tycoons who invested in the arms industry and infrastructure in the Arab world .
We can clearly see , from the very beginnings of the attempt to construct a Pax Americana in Palestine—more or less since 1969—that what the Americans marketed as a peace plan was a formula meant to satisfy the Israeli point of view .
The disastrous fruits of the theoretical games they played with our lives , here in Palestine and Israel , are still with us .
The bargain was the same—Israel was willing to withdraw from only part of the occupied territories .
He resisted and the rest , as we know , is indeed history .
David Ben-Gurion , the first prime minister of Israel , explained that this was part of an attempt to prevent future claims to these villages .
Indeed his village Tantura was not a battlefield between two armies , but rather a civilian space invaded by military troops .
A brief look at Western public opinion is illuminating .
It also had to contend with the fate of the Palestinian refugees , who had been forced from their homes in 1948 .
The rigorous observance of the Sabbath in this dual fashion attracted little if any notice .
It would not be wise to reveal to the public what the record implies about their elected representatives .
The January 8 Security Council resolution called for stopping the flow of arms into Gaza .
As noted earlier , the lack of any such right was reiterated by Israel and its patron in Washington in December 2008 , in their usual isolation and accompanied by the usual resounding silence .
The invasion itself is a far more serious crime .
There were occasional reports of the Israeli navy firing on fishing boats , but these conceal what appears to be a systematic campaign in recent years to drive the fishing industry toward shore—thereby destroying it , because the vast pollution caused by Israel 's destruction of power stations and sewage facilities makes fishing impossible near shore .
But the negotiations were canceled prematurely by Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak .
Of course , again we run into the nullifying principle : This is us , that is them .
The United States has had a century of rich experience in developing paramilitary and police forces to pacify conquered populations and to impose the structure of a long-lasting coercive security state that undermines nationalist and popular aspirations and sustains obedience to the wealthy classes and their foreign associates .
In the end , this war is a crime against ourselves too , a crime against the State of Israel .
But common decency and sense were not allowed to play a role where Palestine was concerned .
The struggle over memory in the case of Palestine seems to be the most important task in this century for anyone committed to the Palestine cause .
The first guideline relates directly to the struggle over historic memory mentioned above .
This would mean challenging the very agenda of the Palestinian Authority that claims that peace with Israel under the old premises will bring an end to the suffering of the occupied people , while the counterargument should be that it is having precisely the opposite effect : deepening the occupation and perpetuating the oppression .
But again themes can sound too abstract and fluid for a movement that seeks desperately to change the public mind after years of being conditioned by a distorted historical narrative , manipulated media coverage , and a lethal futuristic vision .
I do not propose here a solution , but only point out to the need to discuss it now and not later .
On the other hand , the South African government and NGOs have already shown greater enthusiasm for the idea than any other state actor on the international scene .
A large majority of Americans supports the international consensus on a two-state settlement , and even calls for equalizing aid to Israel and the Palestinians .
The first step is to try and stop the escalation of Israeli next steps .
The actions were effective because the groundwork had been laid in many years of education and activism .
With the help of an inciting media and jingoistic public mood the events in the summer of 2006 allowed the policy makers to use brutal military power as a short-term reaction to a problem they had no idea how to solve politically .
The humiliation did not end with the debacle in Lebanon but continued with the capture by the Hamas of an Israeli soldier , Gilad Shalit , in the summer of 2006 .
The ruthless Israeli reaction was also due to the absence of a clear policy .
Very little international attention has been paid to this de-Arabization of Jerusalem—too boring a subject for the Western media to bother with and too elusive for human rights organizations to make a general point about .
The second was the escalation in military means : employment of every possible killing machine the Israeli Army possessed .
If they resisted , they were likely to be imprisoned without trial , or killed .
There was no wish in a government , which was subjected to an aggressive inquiry and damning report by an official commission into its failure in the north , to allow the Israeli public to dwell on this open wound for too long .
But his colleague , Colonel Gabi Siboni , told an academic conference at the Institute for National Security in Tel-Aviv University that this would apply to the Gaza Strip as well .
Groups that were not affiliated with Hamas retaliated with several rockets , and public opinion in Israel was now ready for a larger operation .
The facts and the reasoning were not concealed ; rather , they were openly published alongside reverential commentary on Washington 's sincere dedication to democracy .
The kinds of restrictions on movement used to destroy Gaza have long been in force in the West Bank as well , less cruelly but with grim effects on life and the economy .
Perhaps this was intended as irony , though it seems not .

Tagliabue follows the SHK line in failing to raise these questions .
In his earlier articles Tagliabue followed this line , and it is implicit in this summing-up article , although it is a wholly unproven Sterling gimmick .
What remains of their charge is the possibility that media coverage of the Tet offensive was technically incompetent , although subordinated to elite requirements .
It has always been possible to start small-circulation journals and to produce mimeographed or photocopied news letters sent around to a tiny audience .
We believe that the same dichotomization applies in the domestic sphere .

To postulate otherwise would be to acknowledge something other than benevolent ends .
See PEHR , II.6 for excerpts from the latter study .
Or it would be if anyone accepted it .
Actually you could do a quick research study on this .
For this reason it is very important to keep these things from the public , because the public would never accept this .
NC And that is why they had to lie about it .
So part of the job of intellectuals , including the media , is to maintain systems of false belief in order to keep people marginalized so that they will not act on their moral instincts .
But Britain has less , much less , protection for freedom of speech than the US does .
For one thing you do not get caught out with leaked memos later , and telling the truth is simple , lying involves complications .

According to Panamanian human rights groups , the U.S. bombing of the El Chorillo slums and other civilian targets killed several thousand poor people , far more than the estimated toll of the invasion of Kuwait .
Massacres of that scale are rare , and to acknowledge this one would be doctrinally difficult .
Highly credible church sources estimated that 3,000–5,000 were murdered from February through July .
It was Texaco that supplied oil to the Franco regime in the late 1930s , violating the embargo and U.S. law , while Washington pretended that it did not know what was being reported in the left press—later conceding quietly that it of course knew all along .

We do not even know how to find out whether someone fully understands a Shaw play .
By such standards , an even more viable democratic system was that of Fascist Japan thirty years ago , where more than a dozen cabinets fell under not-dissimilar circumstances .
Considerations such as these-which I have not tried to justify but only to formulate-seem to me to provide the framework within which an American should ask himself what is his responsibility as a citizen .
There is no profession that can claim with greater authenticity that its concern is the intellectual culture of the society or that it possesses the tools for the analysis of ideology and the critique of social knowledge and its use .

Though South-East Asia has not been the most critical area , nevertheless its potential in this regard has not been overlooked .
It is difficult to think of any major component of US policy that departs from this general pattern .
I had expected more sophistication , more outright deception in place of the self-deception revealed by tlme documentary record .
But since a benevolent power like the United States evidently could not undertake such a task , it was necessary to apply some semantic surgery to convert the Viet Minh into agents of foreign aggression , while the French became the defenders of the independence of Indochina .

This option , which Taylor does not mention , was not adopted by the postwar Tribunals either .
The Rule of Force in International Affairs The conclusion that Nuremberg is to be understood as the judgment of victors , rather than as the achievement of a new level of international morality , is reinforced by Taylor 's discussion of aggressive war .
His discussion of aggressive war seems to me inadequate in other respects as well , a matter to which I return below .
As in the Philippines 65 years ago , our troops are thousands of miles from home in uncomfortable , dangerous and unfamiliar surroundings .
That the leaders and populations of the imperial powers may even succumb to these delusions is hardly significant .
The Americans who are now fighting in South Viet-Nam have come to appreciate this fact out of first-hand experience.44 Today , there is vastly more evidence to support Fall 's conclusion .

SCHOLARS , THE PENTAGON PAPERS,supra note 14 , provides new information relevant to North Vietnamese troop commitment .
This regiment allegedly was operating in northwestern Kontum Province in II Corps .
The extent of American involvement in counterrevolutionary warfare in the postwar period cannot be realistically estimated .
And the fifth question that I want to talk a little about is what policy options there are in fighting this war against terrorism and dealing with the situations that led to it .
During this period , Europe did suffer murderous wars , but that was European killers murdering one another .
Because the Europeans , including us , had developed such massive weapons of destruction that that game just have to be over .
The Reagan administration came into office twenty years ago declaring that the war against international terrorism would be the core of our foreign policy….describing it in terms of the kind I just mentioned and others .
Nicaragua then went to the General Assembly where there is technically no veto but a negative US vote amounts to a veto .
It passed a similar resolution with only the United States , Israel , and El Salvador opposed .

But that ’ s a small part of it .
It ’ s now the second poorest country in the Hemisphere .
In 1999 , Colombia replaced Turkey as the leading recipient of US arms worldwide , that is excluding Israel and Egypt which are a separate category .
Well if you take a look at the flow of US arms to Turkey , Turkey always got a lot of US arms .

In fact , if we do turn him over , who knows what he would say .
Well the Bush administration wisely backed off from that .
Well we ought to make it possible to discuss it .
Because , in the end , our sense of being hosts of a special guest was replaced with a much bigger one : that our home was richer with the sense of freedom Chomsky ’ s visit helped us reach .
This book testifies to how dedicated Professor Chomsky is to the issues he embraces in his active pursuit of freedom and fundamental justice .
I will use the term intending you to hear quotes around the phrase ‘ cognitive revolution ’ , expressing some scepticism ; it wasn ’ t all that much of a revolution in my opinion .
Cartesian science arose in part from puzzlement over the difference—if any— between humans and machines .
But under comparable circumstances , a human is only ‘ incited and inclined ’ to do so .
According to the mechanical world view , there can be no empty space : motion is caused by direct contact .
But it ’ s not very hard to translate them into contemporary accounts in terms of neural systems transmitting signals which somehow do the same thing—still just stories in a certain measure , in that not a great deal is understood .
There were , of course , fundamental differences .
The problems that Newton sought to overcome remained very troubling for centuries , and many physicists feel that they still are .
One can doubtless devise artificial distinctions that allow such problems to be formulated , but the exercise seems to make little sense , and indeed is never undertaken apart from the mental aspects of the world .
These ideas had been clarified enormously in the formal sciences .
Through the centuries , it has been understood that there must be something right about the idea .
The hardware–software distinction raises all sorts of problems that do not arise in the study of an organic object .
This approach embodies a number of assumptions that are less than obvious .
For many categories of expressions , parsing fails completely or is extremely difficult .
The standard method of the sciences is to study each of these levels , try to discover their properties , and seek some kind of convergence .
But it was not reduction of chemistry to physics .
Some believe it will be by means of the intermediate level of neurophysiology , perhaps neural nets .
If so , that should not come as a great surprise .
This is even true of invented objects , even impossible ones .
Judgments can be rather delicate , involving factors that have barely been explored .
We are unaware of what we know without inquiry , and it could well turn out to be inaccessible to consciousness , so that we can learn about it only as we learn about circulation of the blood and visual perception .
It seems that some such processes are blocked , even if legitimate at each step , because others are more optimal .
The interface properties , imposed by the systems among which language is embedded , set constraints on what this faculty must be if it is to function within the mind/brain .
And asymmetries , independent principles with much the same explanatory force , and other oddities that deface the picture of nature are viewed with a degree of scepticism .
It is rather recent , dating to Linus Pauling ’ s discovery of the physical nature of the chemical bond just 60 years ago , in terms of radically changed notions of ‘ physical ’ .
Let ’ s turn to the second and narrower of the two topics with which I began : the question of how elements of language relate to other things in the world .
The representational thesis that the central fact about language is that it represents the world , and the central question of semantics is how it does so .
Priestley , who seems to have pursued Locke ’ s suggestion more fully than anyone else , concluded that matter is no more ‘ incompatible with sensation and thought ’ than with attraction and repulsion .
Hence there is no mind-body problem , no question about reduction of the mental to the physical , or even unification of the two domains .
The prevailing picture , established in the modern period particularly by Gottlob Frege , is based on three principles : I There is a common store of thoughts .
Principle I seems groundless at best , senseless at worst .
But it makes no more sense to postulate a ‘ common language ’ that they share than a common shape or a common area .
From some points of view , the greater Boston area is a place ; from others not .
If by ‘ conventions ’ we mean something like ‘ regularities in usage ’ , then we can put the matter aside ; these are few and scattered , and do not begin to serve the purposes for which the notions are invoked .
This is agreed for physics , perhaps ‘ hard science ’ generally .
The ‘ same essence ’ approach to the meanings of so-called ‘ natural kind terms ’ seems at best very dubious , along with the notions ‘ rigid designator ’ and the like .
Such inquiry can only benefit from recognition of this reality , instead of denying it on irrational and often ideological grounds .
Others , one can only stare at in bewilderment .
But these are not the factors that concern us here .
These crimes became the very symbol of evil , placed alongside those of Hitler and Stalin , where they remain in the approved list of twentieth century horrors .
The fact—and fact it is—is perhaps worth pondering .
If Soviet intellectuals ignored or justified Soviet crimes , that was criminal .
The event certainly took place , but it is unmentionable , unthinkable within the intellectual culture— which cannot even plead fear in self-justification .
And in the middle there are the moderates , like George Bush , who explained that ‘ Hanoi knows today that we seek only answers without the threat of retribution for the past ’ .
The adjacent column reports the failure of the Japanese ‘ unambiguously ’ to accept the blame for their ‘ wartime aggression ’ , revealing again the flaw in the Japanese character that has so puzzled American commentators .
For reasons too obvious to review , the topic of Orwell ’ s unpublished introduction is far more important for Westerners than yet another exposure of the crimes of the hated enemy in his most famous work , a few years later .
Such theoretical understanding as we have is far too thin to carry much weight .
The argument is scarcely more than an intellectual reflex , considered so obviously valid as to pass unnoticed , the presupposition of all further inquiry .
Ware focuses on the journals established and run by mechanics and ‘ factory girls ’ in industrial towns near Boston , ‘ the Athens of America ’ and home of its greatest universities .
That goal can be attained by extending to the direction of the economy the principles of democratic politics ’ .
Much the same is true today , as will quickly be discovered by anyone who sweeps aside the fog of rhetoric and looks at the reality of ‘ economic liberalism ’ and the ‘ entrepreneurial values ’ it fosters .
The ‘ aristocrats ’ are ‘ those who fear and distrust the people , and wish to draw all powers from them into the hands of the higher classes ’ .
At last others too are coming to understand that ‘ the free market is the wave of the future—a future for which America is both the gatekeeper and the model ’ .
Suppose then that we adopt the doctrine and keep just to ‘ our little region over here ’ right now , in 1995 , before the next change of course takes effect—somehow always leaving us on the same track .
They also may have had the highest real wages in the world at the time and the best conditions for working class organisation , so the most detailed recent scholarship indicates , contrary to long-standing beliefs .
They were created by the sacrifice of Indian manufacturers ’ .
In contemporary Newspeak , the word is to be pronounced ‘ jobs ’ .
The facts are ‘ very little known ’ , Childers writes , ‘ because of course such things do not get reported by the dominant Northern media ’ .
There is also opposition to foreign aid , particularly on the part of the 25 per cent of the population who believe it to be the biggest item on the Federal budget .
Nicaragua had elections in 1984 , widely praised by even hostile international observers and by the professional organisation of Latin American scholars , which studied them in unusual depth .
But they could not be controlled , so they did not take place .
In April 1995 , the far-right Heritage Foundation submitted its budget proposal , basically adopted by Congress .
Thus it was in the service of democracy that radio , later television , was kept from the public domain and handed over to a few huge corporations ; private tyranny equals freedom .
The remarks refer specifically to the aircraft industry established by public funds and wartime profiteering , but they were understood to generalise .
As industry representative in Washington , Symington regularly demanded that the military budget ‘ meet the requirements of the aircraft industry ’ , as he put it .
For them , the welfare state must flourish .
Furthermore , the ‘ great beast ’ has to be dealt with somehow , and the easiest way is to frighten them .
Not that crime isn ’ t a real threat to safety and survival—it is , and has been for a long time .
Contact time between parents and children has declined radically .
But some are doing fine , as the same sources exult .
The Gulf War established US domination of the Middle East at a level never before achieved , making it possible for Washington to organise the ‘ peace process ’ according to US guidelines , beginning at the Madrid meetings in October 1991 .
The information system agreed , continuing to bar authentic Iraqi dissidents from the mainstream media .
In June , Ma ’ ale Yisrael was established as the 145th settlement in the West Bank , against the orders of the government but with its acquiescence .
Furthermore , ‘ building has been barred on most of the area that remains in Palestinian hands ’ .
The policies were designed by Mayor Teddy Kollek , who has been much admired in the West as an outstanding democrat and humanitarian .
Their condition ‘ would be the closest thing in our time to slavery ’ if it were not ‘ an agreed-upon deal ’ —thanks to the conditions of ‘ really existing capitalism ’ in much of the world .
Many villages have no running water at all , and even such cities as Hebron and Ramallah lack running water for many hours a day in the summer .
It might be noted that US payments to Israel are not only extraordinary in scale , but also illegal .
No accommodation is conceivable , so the adversary must be destroyed—by virtue of its essential nature , not ours .
Its ‘ fundamental purpose ’ is ‘ to assure the integrity and vitality of our free society ’ and to safeguard its values throughout the world .
Washington and the media could hardly contain their delight over these successes .
US Deputy Chief of Mission Francis Galbraith , later Ambassador , ‘ made clear ’ to high-ranking officers that ‘ The embassy and the USC were generally sympathetic with and admiring of what the army was doing ’ .
Recall also that the latter term is construed quite broadly , including virtually anyone who gets in the way , and that the problem posed by the ‘ Communists ’ is sometimes squarely faced .
Apparently the Australian government agreed , welcoming him a few months later as part of an Indonesian delegation studying civil and defence research technology .
In this regard , the Indonesian coup is certainly one of the most significant events of the 20th century ’ .
The story did begin to get some attention by 1980 , when it was becoming a little hard to miss the similarity to the Pol Pot atrocities of the same years .
It would be misleading to say that the ruling of the World Court was ignored .
To its credit , the government of Australia took an active role throughout and co-sponsored the final draft .
The US State Department ’ s Historical Advisory Committee—not exactly a gang of radicals—just wrote a formal letter to the Secretary of State objecting to the violations of the traditional rules on declassification , an interference with freedom of information initiated by Reaganite statist reactionaries who strongly believed that the increasingly powerful state they nurtured should be protected from public scrutiny .
They might turn out to be less than happy that the budget needed by the armed forces for East Timor ‘ has drastically reduced the state budget allocated to education and health ’ , as the courageous Indonesian activist and scholar George Aditjondro reports , citing scholarly studies .
Chicago Council on Foreign Relations , American Public Opinion and US Foreign Policy , 1995 .

The USSR had by then given Indonesia US$1 billion in aid , they report .
See also his paper and others in International Law .
Let me begin by counter-posing two different conceptions of democracy .
That was a major achievement , and it led to a further achievement .
He argued that in a properly functioning democracy there are classes of citizens .
You do n't give a three-year-old that kind of freedom because the three-year-old does n't know how to handle that freedom .
Correspondingly , you do n't allow the bewildered herd to become participants in action .
That means they have to have instilled in them the beliefs and doctrines that will serve the interests of private power .
If they can achieve that , then they can be part of the specialized class .
Make sure that they remain at most spectators of action , occasionally lending their weight to one or another of the real leaders , who they may select among .
We 've got to prevent their roar and trampling .
Usually the population is pacifist , just like they were during the First World War .
Bernays himself had an important achievement in this respect .
So when you go to a European country and give a political talk , it may very likely be in the union hall .
It 's all been a marvelous success from the point of view in deterring the threat of democracy , achieved under conditions of freedom , which is extremely interesting .
They are important facts , important for those who care about what kind of society they live in .
Nevertheless , people are acquiring an ability and a willingness to think things through .
Skepticism about power has grown , and attitudes have changed on many , many issues .
Everybody thought that the use of violence to suppress people out there was just right .
Just having them watch the Superbowl and the sitcoms may not be enough .
But they 're losing their attractiveness as an enemy , and it 's getting harder and harder to use that one , so some new ones have to be conjured up .
Remember , this is the account of what happened to one man .
That tells you how a well-functioning propaganda system works .
Again , it 's child 's play to demonstrate that those could n't possibly have been the reasons for going to war , because we do n't uphold these principles .
No reason was given for going to war that could not be refuted by a literate teenager in about two minutes .
That again is the hallmark of a totalitarian culture .
